Face mask typically refers to a covering that is worn over the nose and mouth to provide 
protection from airborne particles and potentially harmful substances. The primary purpose of 
a face mask is to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets that may contain viruses, 
bacteria, or other contaminants, especially in situations where maintaining physical distance 
is important. Computer Vision can help to monitor the use of face masks based on images
captured via CCTV. A previous study built a mask detection system using Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNN) based models, which produced high accuracy but was limited to the 
front face. This research focuses on leveraging computer vision and machine learning, Deep 
learning techniques for accurate face mask detection. The proposed approach employs 
transfer learning, utilizing MobileNetV2 as the base model, coupled with a custom classifier. 
This model consists of two core components: face detection (faceNet) and face mask 
classification (maskNet), following established machine learning and deep learning 
workflows. Experimental results underscore its effectiveness, achieving a remarkable 97.87% 
accuracy in identifying individuals wearing masks, 98.46% accuracy in detecting those 
without masks, culminating in an impressive overall model accuracy of 98.33%. In addition 
to its primary role in monitoring mask compliance, this research highlights its potential to 
make meaningful contributions to technological progress and endeavors aimed at enhancing 
public health



1.1 Background
Face mask detection has emerged as a significant computer vision task, aimed at determining 
whether an individual in an image or video is wearing a face mask. This task has gained 
immense importance in recent times, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, where 
face masks have been proven to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus [1].
Several approaches are employed for face mask detection, each with its own set of 
methodologies. One traditional approach involves utilizing computer vision techniques like 
edge detection and facial landmark detection. By identifying facial features such as eyes, 
nose, and mouth, this method can subsequently determine whether a person is wearing a face 
mask [3].
In contrast, deep learning presents another approach to face mask detection. Deep learning 
leverages artificial neural networks to learn patterns from vast datasets containing images of 
people both with and without face masks. Once the model is trained on such data, it can 
effectively detect the presence of face masks in new images [3].
Comparing the two approaches, deep learning models have demonstrated higher accuracy 
when compared to traditional computer vision techniques for face mask detection. However, 
it is important to consider that deep learning models may demand more computational 
resources for training and deployment, making them computationally expensive.
To build an efficient face mask detection system, researchers must consider the trade-offs 
between traditional computer vision methods and deep learning models, taking into account 
the specific requirements and constraints of their applications. As this technology continues 
to evolve, advancements in both approaches are expected to play a pivotal role in public 
health and safety measures [6].


1.2 Problem Statement
The face mask detection task involves developing a computer vision system capable of 
accurately identifying whether individuals in images or videos are wearing face masks. This 
task has gained significant importance due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where face 
masks serve as a crucial preventive measure to mitigate the transmission of the virus [1].
The primary objective of this research is to create an efficient and reliable face mask 
detection model that can be deployed in real-world scenarios. The model should be capable 
of detecting face masks with high accuracy and robustness, even in challenging environments 
with variations in mask types, lighting conditions, partial face visibility, and the presence of 
other facial coverings such as Naqab, Sunglasses.
To achieve this goal, the research will explore and compare different approaches for face 
mask detection, including traditional computer vision techniques, such as edge detection and 
facial landmark detection, and deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks. 
The study will evaluate the performance and computational costs of each approach to 
determine the most suitable method for the specific application.

Furthermore, the research aims to address the following key challenges in face mask 
detection:
Variability in Mask Types: Different face mask types, such as surgical masks, N95 
respirators, and cloth masks, may introduce variations in appearance, requiring the model to 
adapt accordingly.
Occlusion and Partial Face Visibility: The presence of obstructions or partial visibility of 
facial features can pose challenges in accurately detecting face masks, especially when 
individuals wear additional facial coverings like Naqab.
Real-time Implementation: The model should be optimized for real-time processing to 
facilitate its deployment in public spaces, workplaces, and surveillance systems.
The proposed face mask detection system has potential applications in various domains, 
including public health, safety, and compliance monitoring. By accurately identifying face 
masks in images and videos, the system can contribute to efforts aimed at controlling the 
spread of infectious diseases and ensuring adherence to safety protocols [2, 3
